# G1000 NXi with an integrated Arduino Mega for Flight Simulators

Welcome to the G1000 NXi Mega project! This repository contains the schematic and PCB design files for a custom-built G1000 avionics panel, designed specifically for use with flight simulators like Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane. Using MobiFlight to connect the G1000 hardware to your simulator of choice.

## Features
- Fully functional G1000 avionics system designed for flight simulation enthusiasts and student pilots.
- Integrated Arduino Mega for simplified connections and functionality.
- Open-source schematic and PCB designs for easy replication and modification.
- Compatible with Microsoft Flight Simulator and X-Plane.

## Getting Started
To get started with the G1000 NXi Mega:
1. Download the schematic and PCB files from the `design` folder.
2. Review the build documentation in the `docs` folder.
3. Use the included Gerber files to order PCBs from your preferred manufacturer.
4. Follow the assembly instructions to build your own G1000 avionics panel.

### Prerequisites
- Basic knowledge of electronics and PCB assembly.
- Access to a 3D printer (if building the enclosure).
- Arduino IDE and a spare Arduino for programming the Arduino Mega.
